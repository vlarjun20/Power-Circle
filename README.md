# Power Circle
This repo consists of code and details of a project which we work -"Powercycle" at HACKVERSE 5.0 at NITK, Suratkal. The project is based on using the excess renewable energy especially solar energy, produced domestically. 
The main motive is to use the surplus energy produced to meet the needs of the consumers in need, making the local people both consumers and producers. The unit of energy considered is 1kw, which can be tokenized as 1ETK(electric token).
The surplus energy is transferred to local grids where various house or buildings are connected for electricity. These local grids collected the energy and transfer the energy. The transactions and readings are stored in the blockchain.
This mainly reduces the central dependency on the state and encourages the use of renewable energy at the maximum potential level. The producers also get a side source of income through energy sharing .

<h3>Formula</h3>
total energy_produced(ep) = input()
total energy_used(es) = input()
surplus_energy= ep-es 

tokenize:
 1 etk = 1kwph

price could increase and decrease according to the demand-supply


get the no.of tokens availed
